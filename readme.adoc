== Introduction

It tries to parse `request.body` as JSON.
If succeeded, it will store an Ruby object parsed from JSON in `json`.
If `request.body` happened not to have a valid JSON,
it will halt the request with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400[400 status code].

A response will be converted to JSON by calling `#to_json` on the latest action object.

Here is an echo server(it returns the same JSON posted by a request):

[source,ruby]
----
require 'hobby'
require 'hobby-json'

class Echo
  include Hobby
  include JSON

  get { json }
end
----
