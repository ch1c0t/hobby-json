= Hobby-JSON

This repository provides a https://github.com/ch1c0t/hobby[Hobby] extension
for JSON requests and responses.

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
gem install hobby-json
----

== Introduction

It tries to parse `request.body` as JSON.
If succeeded, it will store a parsed Ruby object in `json`.
If `request.body` happened not to have a valid JSON,
it will halt the request with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400[400 status code].

A response will be converted to JSON by calling `#to_json` on the latest action object.

Here is an echo server(it returns the same JSON posted by a request):

[source,ruby]
----
require 'hobby'
require 'hobby/json'

class Echo
  include Hobby
  include JSON

  post { json }
end
----

== Development

To run the specs:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rspec
----

To perform mutation analysis:
[source,bash]
----
bundle exec mutant --use rspec 'Hobby::JSON*'
----
