= Hobby-JSON

This repository provides a https://github.com/ch1c0t/hobby[Hobby] extension
for JSON requests and responses.

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
gem install hobby-json
----

== Introduction

It tries to parse `request.body` as JSON.
If succeeded, it will store a parsed Ruby object in `json`.
If `request.body` happened not to have a valid JSON,
it will halt the request with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400[400 status code].

A response will be converted to JSON by calling `.to_json` on the latest action object.

Here is an echo service(it returns the same JSON posted by a request):

[source,ruby]
----
require 'hobby'
require 'hobby/json'

class Echo
  include Hobby
  include JSON

  post { json }
end
----

Another example could be an adding service.
It expects to get an array of numbers in the `numbers` field, after which it sums them up,
and returns the result in the `result` field.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'hobby'
require 'hobby/json'

class Adder
  include Hobby
  include JSON

  post do
    { result: json['numbers'].sum }
  end
end
----

You can put this in `config.ru`:

[source,ruby]
----
run Adder.new
----

and run it with `rackup`. Then, the service can be accessed like so:

[source,bash]
----
âžœ  ~ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"numbers":[1,2,3]}' http://localhost:9292
{"result":6}%
----

== Development

To run the specs:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rspec
----

To perform mutation analysis:
[source,bash]
----
bundle exec mutant --use rspec 'Hobby::JSON*' --include lib --require hobby/json
----
